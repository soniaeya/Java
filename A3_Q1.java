/* Question 1: Sentence Scan Program
This program takes in a sentence and displays some data about the sentence, including length of each word, the number
of words in the sentence, the length of the shortest and longest words and the average length of the words.
To do so, we need to transform the sentence into and array, and use for loops to loop through each element.

The user inputs a sentence, read as a String variable by the program with the Scanner method (.nextLine()).
The .split("") method transforms the sentence into an array(arrLetters[]), where the letters of the sentence
are its elements, and the .split(" ") method transforms the sentence into another array(arrWords[]), where the
words of the sentence are its elements. If statements are used to exclude punctuation marks and whitespaces from the
letter count.
