        /* From the input screen, a list of Covid-19 symptoms are associated with a Symptom Code (10 to 23). Then, the user must choose the symptom description that best describes their current health symptoms
        and input the corresponding system code (an integer variable between -128 to 127) accordingly. Then, the program will output the symptom category and advice notes according to the symptom.
        If the user enters an integer value not within the available range, an error message will appear. The user's inputs are taken in with a scanner method, the corresponding outputs are regulated by a series of if statements.
        Logical operators such as the Logical AND (&&), and the Logical OR (||) is used to isolate the range of the input.
